# GeoSim-FinalProject
Final Project for the Geosimulation Course of the University of MÃ¼nster (WS 17/18)

In this project the simulation model of the Paper: "Spatial vegetation patterns and imminent desertification in Mediterranean arid ecosystems" by S. Kefi et al. is reproduced with a NetLogo model.

The paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06111

To execute this model download the NetLogo software (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml) and open it within the program.
